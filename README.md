# Key Chain

Simple python implementation of encrypting your a txt file containing your password;
 with python and a implementation of Vigenere + Permutation box cipher.






- The program is Case sensitive, and retains cases in encrypted password.
- The vigenere will encrypt numbers as well as letters.

Password_protektor.py will allow you to either...
- Add a new password
- Remove a password
- Unlock keychain / view password
- Create a new keychain

Similar to the Apple Keychain but my own implementation


### Future developments

- QT / GUI implementation


#### TO DO LIST

3. Wrapper Protekk
4. Wrapper Unlock
5. PasswordProtekt.py
6. Add more cipher logic!!
7. Can we update passwords without revealing?

Testing


Done;
1. Implement Vigenere Encrypt and Decrypt
2. Implement Permutation Encrypt and Decrypt
